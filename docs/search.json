    "text": "Note\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\nThis section focuses on the preparation and cleaning of a data set released by the Small Business Administration (for the Paycheck Protection Program) who later informed the public about a $200 billion dollar loss in fraudulent claims. We’ll take a look at the PPP loan data in search of an answer to the question, what evidence, if any, does the data provide regarding the risk of fraud in PPP/PPS and SBA loans?\nIn testing the hypothesis, results show a statistically significant effect with a p-value at approximately 0, and a 95% confidence interval ranging from 7380.743 to 8022.796. Since the confidence interval does not include zero, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the proportion of missing values in the PPP loan forgiveness application significantly impacted the loan amount forgiven.",

However, the data analysis is not as comprehensive as it should be. Computing limitations scraped a small percentage of the true data. Yet, it does suggest thoroughly completing a PPP loan forgiveness application at the time made a significant difference in how much if the loan would be taken care of.\nThe fact remains that $200 Billion dollars were freely given to fraudulent claims according to the administrations. The information at hand could also suggest that filling the application in a specific way could have led to immediate approval. As you can see below, the forgiveness loan application graded the responses and if the results made the threshold, it allowed for submission of loan forgiveness applications without needing to submit any documentation. Of course this another hypothesis that would need to be tested!",

    "text": "In the aftermath of COVID, businesses in need of assistance applied for “Paycheck Protection Program” Loans (PPP Loans) which offered financial assistance for the sake of keeping the economy afloat during the health crisis. The loans would serve to keep businesses open, current employees paid, and additionally help finance hiring new employees to fill positions. PPP loans were intended to be forgiven (if the business met the SBA defined criteria).\nAs the PPP program launched and the first rounds of payments were released, the internet boomed with people boasting about having received payment. There were rumors that businesses applied for PPP loans with the intention of receiving forgiveness by creating job posts that would dispel applicants. Scammers took to the internet to find people interested in receiving a loan contingent of a percentage of the approval.\n\nThe Small Business Administration, with assistance of The Office of Inspector General, released a report in 2023 informing the public, the SBA had disbursed a total of $200 billion to fraudulent claims. While the report was exclusively about blatant falsification of details (false EIN, false addresses, etc). The SBA released a public list of all companies that applied and received PPP loan funds in 2020. Updated regularly– with its last update being on October 24th 2024.\nWhile the dataset is quite large, it could prove impossible to truly say whether there is more fraud than the report outlined– even if the whispers of the internet could be true. Yet, in the spirit of examining the businesses that submitted claims, my exploratory analysis will seek to answer, what evidence, if any, does the data provide regarding the risk of fraud in PPP/PPS and SBA loans?",
